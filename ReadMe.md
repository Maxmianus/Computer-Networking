# Computer Netowrking Port Knocking Implementation

Purpose of this program is to "hide" a server by only allowing access after a successful port knock, the port knocking
server also attempts to protect itself from DOS and replay attacks. While the port knocking server is running if a client wants 
access to the server they execute the client side of the port knocking program then try to access the web server.
